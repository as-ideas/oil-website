Opt-in Layer is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/as-ideas/oil) as Open Source project. Feel free to download it from there, to fork it and to
make any changes you want. Furthermore, there is a [sandbox](https://oil.axelspringer.com/sandbox/) demonstrating the most important 
features of OIL.
