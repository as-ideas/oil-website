title: "Does OIL provide a managed service?"
---
No. As an Open Source project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/as-ideas/oil), OIL cannot provide a managed service. If you want to
use it you are required to host it by yourself (please see [documentation](https://oil.axelspringer.com/docs/) for details how to do it).
