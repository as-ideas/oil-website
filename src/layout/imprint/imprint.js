          <h1>Privacy policy of OIL-JS</h1>

          <p>We are very pleased about your interest in <b>OIL.JS</b>. To be able to offer <b>OIL.JS</b>, we of course require certain data about you. We take
            the protection of personal data very seriously and always process it in compliance with applicable data protection regulations, in particular the
            European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With this privacy policy, we aim to fully inform you about how, why and to what extent we process
            personal data, and what your rights are as a data subject.</p>
          <h2>1. Data controller and general information</h2>

          <p>Your data will be processed by Axel Springer SE, Axel-Springer-Str. 65, 10888 Berlin, phone: +49
            30 2591 0, E-Mail: <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#097;&#120;&#101;&#108;&#115;&#112;&#114;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#100;&#101;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#097;&#120;&#101;&#108;&#115;&#112;&#114;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#100;&#101;</a> (service provider for the purposes of the Act for Telecommunication Media Services (TMG) and data
            controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

          <p>When we use terms such as “we” or “us”, this is who we are referring to. We consider <b>OIL.JS</b> to mean any sub-pages, content and
            functions (for instance discussion forums, prize draws) present in this document <a href="https://www.oiljs.org">www.oiljs.org.</a> Individual elements of <b>OIL.JS</b> are also
            referred to as “online services” below. The same is meant wherever we refer to a website below.</p>

          <h2>2. Collection and processing of personal data</h2>

          <p>You can usually use online services that do not require payment or registration without providing personal data. In
            certain cases, however, we may process personal data listed under point 3. This is only done as is necessary to provide a functioning website, our content and our
            services. We also process personal data in connection with the use of <b>OIL.JS</b> insofar as you provide such data voluntarily, for instance for the purpose of registration, a prize draw,
            sending us an enquiry, submitting an application to us, subscribing to a publication, or some other legal basis (see point 4). If you do not wish to provide personal data, you will
            unfortunately not be able to make use of our services or will only be able to use them to a limited degree.</p>

          <h2>3. Categories of processed data</h2>

          <p>As soon as you make use of <b>OIL.JS</b>, our system will automatically collect information from the
            computing device accessing the service. The following data may be collected by way of example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Information about the browser type and version used</li>
            <li>The operating system of the user</li>
            <li>Date and time of the access</li>
            <li>Web analysis data / pseudonymised user profiles (cookie ID, ad ID, etc.)</li>
            <li>Websites from which the users access our website</li>
            <li>Websites that the users access from our website</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We also process the following personal data insofar as there is a contract in effect between you and us or if you have provided us with the data by other
            means: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Contact details for webinar (email address)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Legal basis and purposes of processing </h2>

          <p>We only process your data on the basis of one or several potential legal bases. </p>

          <p>Pursuant to the GDPR, personal data may be processed in particular under the terms of a contract or to perform pre-contractual activities, if consent is provided, if
            there is a legitimate interest or compelling statutory cause, or if it becomes necessary to protect vital or public interests.</p>

          <p>On the internet, every device requires a unique address to transmit data, known as an IP address. This IP address
            must be stored, even if only temporarily, for technical reasons in order to enable the website to be downloaded to the user’s end device. Our servers will also store
            your IP address for a period of 14 days for internal security purposes.</p>

          <p>For processing activities encompassed by none or several of the aforementioned legal bases, processing is performed insofar as it is necessary
            to uphold a legitimate interest and insofar as this interest is not outweighed by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms following a thorough
            consideration of the interests as a whole. A legitimate interest can be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the data controller. If personal data is
            processed on this basis, our particular legitimate interest here is in the performance of our business activities for the benefit of all of our employees
            and our shareholders.</p>

          <p>You can object to processing performed on the basis of a legitimate interest at any time (see point 15).</p>

          <p>If data is processed for a purpose other than that specified upon collection, a compatibility test is performed pursuant to Art. 6 para. 4 of the GDPR.
            Continued processing is then only permitted if the original purpose is compatible with the new purpose or if this processing is permitted on a
            specific legal basis. Recognised compatible purposes include the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims under civil law, unless outweighed by an
            interest of the data subject, in which case we will inform you about the change in purpose. If the new purpose is not compatible with the purpose specified
            upon collection, the data will be collected again on a new legal basis. We will also inform you about the change in purpose in this case. </p>

          <h2>5. Place of processing</h2>

          <p>We personally will not transmit your personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, except where permitted by the General Data Protection
            Regulation. We cannot know and cannot influence whether third parties with whom you have concluded a separate contractual agreement (for instance with
            Facebook, if you have a Facebook account) transmit data to countries outside of the European Economic Area.</p>

          <h2>6. Origin of data</h2>

          <p>In certain cases, we also receive data because you have consented to its transmission to us.</p>

          <h2>7. Transmission of your data to third parties</h2>

          <p>We will only transmit your personal data to third parties if transmission is required to comply with our contractual obligations to you if this evidently
            needs to be done through or jointly with another provider (e.g. partnerships), if we are permitted or required by law to transmit the data in any other
            fashion, or if you have provided us with the corresponding consent. </p>

          <p>To provide our service, selected personal data may be transmitted to certain departments within our company, including employees of the Accounting, Product
            Management, Marketing and IT departments. </p>

          <p>In certain cases we also employ external service providers or affiliates commissioned by us to process data on our behalf on the basis of instructions.
            We ensure that such service providers are contractually bound by the strict terms of the GDPR as data processors and that they are prohibited from using
            your data for any other purposes. Data processors employed by us provide the following services in particular: Hosting, subscriber management, customer service, prize draw
            processing, web analysis services (see point 9 for more specific details), logistics, prize shipping, newsletter
            delivery, letter shop, login service, printers, survey/comment services, maintenance and support.</p>

          <h3>Other recipient categories:</h3>

          <p>Data is transmitted to data processors on the basis of Art. 28 para. 1 of the GDPR, and also on the basis of our legitimate interest in economic and technical
            advantages afforded by the employment of specialist data processors as permitted by Art. 6 para. 1 point f of the GDPR.</p>

          <p>Insofar as we are required to do so by law or are permitted to do so under data protection law, we will transmit personal data to public authorities such as
            the police or public prosecution service (Art. 6 para. 1 point c GDPR). This data is transmitted on the basis of our legitimate interest in preventing
            abuse, prosecuting criminal acts and securing, establishing and enforcing legal claims, unless outweighed by your rights and interests in the protection of
            your personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 point f of the GDPR.</p>

          <h2>8. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>

          <p>We make use of cookies, which are small files that your browser deposits in a folder designated for this purpose on your device. This makes it possible, for
            instance, to determine whether you have visited a website before. With your consent, cookies can also be used to store account details for an online
            service, meaning that you do not need to enter these account details every time you open the website. Many cookies contain what is known as a “cookie ID”,
            which is a unique identifier for the cookie. It consists of a string of characters which websites and servers can associate with the specific web
            browser in which the cookie has been stored. This enables visited websites and servers to differentiate between the specific browser of the data subject and
            other web browsers containing different cookies. A specific web browser can be recognised and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>

          <p>We use two types of cookies. The first are technically necessary cookies, without which the functionality of our website would be limited. The second is the
            optional cookie, which we use to make our website more user-friendly. The user data collected in technically necessary cookies is not used to create user
            profiles. Analysis cookies are used to improve the quality of our website and its content. We use analysis cookies to ascertain how the website
            is being used, allowing us to continuously optimise our services. Further information on individual analysis services can be found under point 9 of this privacy policy. </p>

          <p>Advertisements are usually delivered by third-party providers. These may use information on your visits, provided that your device configuration allows this, so that
            advertisements on products and services that may be of interest to you are displayed. Specific contact details such as your name, postal address, email
            address or telephone number will not be transmitted under any circumstances.</p>

          <p>You can prevent cookies from being set by us at any time by configuring the web browser that you are using, which represents your objection to the setting of
            cookies. Previously set cookies can also be deleted at any time using a web browser or another software solution. This is possible in all standard web
            browsers. If you deactivate cookies in your chosen web browser, it may not be possible for you to use all of the functions of our website in full. </p>

          <p>Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally. In any case, the use of cookies is justified on the basis of our legitimate interest in designing the website to
            meet demand and in conducting statistical analyses of <b>OIL.JS</b> (Art. 6 para. 1 point f GDPR).</p>

          <h2>9. (Web) analysis services</h2>

          <p>In order to continuously improve our services and adapt them to the interests of our users, and in order to display usage-based online advertising, we make use
            of a number of analysis services that collect and analyse data on our website our behalf. These service providers process pseudonymised user data in
            accordance with instructions on the basis of a data processing agreement. The data is not stored together with other personal data of the user. You can
            deactivate the individual analysis services at any time with effect for the future. Specific information on the individual analysis services employed by us
            can be found below: </p>

          <h2>10. Storage duration</h2>

          <p>We only store personal data as long as we are authorised to do so, as long as the purpose of processing is still relevant and provided that you have not objected to
            processing. Statutory retention periods govern how long personal data is stored for. Once this period has expired, the corresponding data is routinely erased.</p>

          <h2>11. Contact details and your rights as a data subject</h2>

          <p>Should you have any queries or comments on data protection and privacy or wish to exercise your rights as a data subject, please contact our data protection officer at any time:</p>

          <h3>Information and rectification</h3>

          <p>You can receive information at any time and at no charge about whether we are processing personal data related to you and also about which information we are
            specifically storing about you. You are also entitled to receive a copy of the stored information. You can also have errors in your data corrected and missing
            information completed. </p>

          <h3>Erasure, restriction of processing and “right to be forgotten”</h3>

          <p>You can request that your data be erased and its processing restricted. Please note that statutory retention obligations are in effect for contracts relating to
            paid services (such as the purchase of a subscription to <b>OIL.JS</b>) and that we will therefore not always be able to fully erase your data completely
            in all cases. In this case, your data will be labelled to the effect that future processing should be restricted.</p>

          <h3>Data portability</h3>

          <p>Where applicable, you also have the right to have your personal data transmitted to you or to another data controller in a structured, standardised and
            machine-readable format, as long as processing is performed on the basis of consent or contract using automated procedures. You also have the right to have
            the personal data transmitted directly from one data controller to another, provided that it is technically feasible to do so and does not infringe upon
            the rights and freedoms of other persons.</p>

          <h3>Withdrawal of consent, objecting to processing </h3>

          <div className="withdrawal-box">

            <p>You can withdraw your previously-given consent at any time with effect for the future by contacting the aforementioned address. </p>

            <p>Moreover, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time (where such processing is
              based on a legitimate or public interest) for reasons arising from your particular circumstances. This also applies to profiling activities based on these
              provisions. If such an objection is received, we will cease to process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
              processing that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, of if the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of
              legal claims.</p>

            <p>If we are processing personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object to the processing of
              your personal data at any time for the purpose of such marketing by contacting the aforementioned address. This also applies to profiling insofar as it is
              connected with such direct marketing. You also have the right to file an objection for reasons arising from your particular circumstances against
              processing of your personal data that we are engaged in for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes, unless such processing is required
              to perform a task that is in the public interest.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Right of complaint</h3>

          <p>You also have the right to submit a complaint to the competent supervisory authority and to seek legal remedies. The supervisory authority to whom the complaint was submitted
            will notify the complainant about the status and result of their complaint, including the option of seeking a legal remedy through a court of law.</p>
